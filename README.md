# ParametrizedMoodMusic

How can we create music with a particular mood?

There are many components to this question, such as tempo, rhythm, and tamber, but in this repo I am focusing on melody and harmony.
The Racket file mix-modes.rkt creates a continuous song with a random melody and chord progression, but each is set within its own mode.
The idea is that the mixture of modes will create different moods, by creating different harmonies and dissonances.

Or you could you could use this repo to train your ear to hear mixtures of modes.

Either way, it is a starting point of a much longer journey.
Have fun! :)
